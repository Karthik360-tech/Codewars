This is a guessing game in which computer itself enquires us to guess the number by BINARY SEARCH : 
Binary search is a searching algorithm in which the target value is compared with the middle element of the sorted array .
This is a game for guessing the number between 0-100.
The game returns the guessed number along with the number of guesses ..! 

SOLUTION : 
guess = 0
def average(a , b) :
    avrg = (a+b)//2
    return avrg
		
def guessing(a,b,guess) :
    print(f'Is it {average(a,b)} ?')
    choice = str(input('Yes / No :'))
    
		if choice == 'y' :
        guess += 1
        print('No.of guesses : ',guess)
        print('The number is ',average(a,b))
    
		elif choice == 'n' :
        guess += 1
        choice = input('Is it higher or lower ? ')
        if choice == 'lower' :
            guessing(a,average(a,b),guess)
        elif choice == 'higher' :
            guessing(average(a,b),b,guess)
    else :
        print('WRONG INPUT .. RETRY :-')
        guessing(a,b,guess)

guessing(0,100,guess)
